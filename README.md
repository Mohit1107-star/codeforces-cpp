# 🚀 Codeforces Daily C++ Practice

Welcome to my personal Codeforces journey where I solve one new problem every day using **C++** and organize them **topic-wise**. This repository helps me build fluency in C++, sharpen problem-solving skills, and track my daily consistency.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Master **C++ STL** (vectors, sets, maps, priority queues, etc.)
- Practice **common algorithms**: greedy, DP, binary search, graph
- Write **clean, fast, and readable code**
- Use `make` and terminal for local testing
- Build a GitHub streak with daily pushes

---

## ⚙️ Run Any File

Use the provided Makefile to compile and run any `.cpp`:

```bash
make run FILE=greedy/A_Minimum_Coins.cpp
```

💡 About Me

- I'm a software developer at Siemens, now learning C++ deeply to expand into system-level and high-performance programming.
- I also solve LeetCode, build real-world projects, and love system design
